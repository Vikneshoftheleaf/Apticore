      "options": ["7.5 degrees", "22.5 degrees", "30 degrees", "37.5 degrees"],
      "correctAnswer": "7.5 degrees",
      "explanation": "The minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute. At 15 minutes, it is at 90 degrees. The hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute. At 15 minutes, it moves 7.5 degrees from 3. Angle = |90 - 97.5| = 7.5 degrees.",

      "correctAnswer": "21 minutes past 4",
      "explanation": "The relative speed of the hands is 5.5 degrees per minute. At 4:00, the hour hand is at 120 degrees. Time required = 120 / 5.5 ≈ 21.82 minutes, approximately 21 minutes.",
